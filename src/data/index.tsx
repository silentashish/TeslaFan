  homeInfo:
    "GameStop Corp. is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. The company is headquartered in Grapevine (a suburb of Dallas), Texas, United States, and is the world's largest video game retailer, operating 5,509 retail stores throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe as of February 1, 2020.The company was founded in Dallas in 1984 as Babbage's, and took on its current name in 1999. The company's retail stores primarily operate under the GameStop, EB Games, ThinkGeek, and Micromania-Zing brands. The company declined during the mid-late 2010s due to the shift of video game sales to online storefronts and failed investments by GameStop in smartphone retail. However, in 2021, the company's stock price skyrocketed due to a short squeeze orchestrated by users of the Internet forum r/wallstreetbets.",

    'GameStop traces its roots to Babbage\'s, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin. The company was named after Charles Babbage and opened its first store in Dallas\'s NorthPark Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.Babbage\'s began selling Nintendo games in 1987.The company went public in 1988.By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage\'s sales.homeInfoThird: Government efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 required GameStop to close the physical operation of all of its 3,500 stores from roughly March to May 2020, though not without some controversy in the early stages. Throughout this time, it continued with online and curbside sales. Sherman and the board of directors took a 50% pay cut while other executives took a 30% cut to offset losses. While digital sales grew by 519%, its retail dropped by more than 30% in the same period from the prior year, and the chain reported a US$165 million loss in contrast to a US$6.8 million for the same quarter in 2019. However, with the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 still planned for release in the latter part of 2020, Sherman expected to be able to recover from these losses. In mid-March 2020, GameStop faced criticism for its response to the coronavirus pandemic in North America, with employees and social media users accusing the company of placing its business ahead of the safety of its staff and customers, in order to capitalize on an influx of video game purchases and related products for entertainment during the pandemic and related lockdowns.[83][84][85] GameStop stated that it would suspend in-store events (including midnight launches) and the use of demo stations, perform additional cleaning, and structure lines and limit store capacity to enforce physical distancing.[85] In order to prevent enlarged crowds for two high-profile video game releases on March 20 â€” Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Doom Eternal, GameStop announced that it would begin selling Doom Eternal in its stores a day ahead of its official release date. Polygon reported on March 17 that several stores in the San Francisco area had remained open, seemingly in violation of a stay-at-home order issued by Bay Area counties that restricts non-essential business. Several employees told Polygon and Vice that they did not receive additional cleaning supplies that were to be provided by corporate, requiring them to purchase them on their own and request reimbursement. In regards to orders restricting non-essential businesses, a memo obtained by Kotaku on March 19 indicated that GameStop saw itself as an essential business because some of its technology products are relevant to enhancing remote work (a practice that has seen expansion due to the pandemic). In a statement later that day, GameStop reiterated the safety measures that it had put in place, and also announced that it would reduce store hours and suspend all trade-ins until at least March 29, and offer curbside pickup. The company stated that it aimed to "continue to provide essential products to our customers that allows them to stay connected, and provide products that allow business and consumers to work remotely", as they were serving the "significant need for technology solutions" at this point in time.[88][87] An employee of a GameStop store in Athens, Georgia (which was shut down on March 20 by order of the police to comply with a similar order in Athens-Clark County) disputed the argument, saying that the high-end, gaming-oriented peripherals (such as keyboards and mice) sold at GameStop were not necessarily essential for remote work, and that cheaper alternatives were readily available at stores allowed to remain open, such as Walmart. California had announced a state-wide stay-at-home order on March 19; while GameStop had originally stated to its stores it was an essential retail business, by March 20 they had instead decided to close down its California branches, while keeping most other nationwide stores open.[89][84] Following similar stay-at-home orders in New York and Illinois over the following days, GameStop announced that it would close all locations effective March 22, with selected locations continuing to offer contact-free curbside pickup (where an employee, wearing either gloves or a bag over their hands, would slip the customer\'s order through the front door, remaining behind the glass)[90] and home delivery.[91] In early April, a location in Dorchester, Boston received a nuisance citation by local police, who deemed the curbside pickup a violation of the Massachusetts stay-at-home order. GameStop subsequently ceased offering curbside pickup in the state. A GameStop and ThinkGeek store in New York City in November 2020, boarded up due to concerns of violence following the presidential election GameStop\'s Canadian subsidiary EB Games faced similar criticism on March 20 as well, as morning lineups for the new Animal Crossing and Doom games at a Toronto location induced large public gatherings discouraged by officials. The city\'s public health chief Eileen de Villa stated that the gathering did not "line up with what we expect from those in our community who are interested in protecting and strengthening our community". Mayor John Tory accused the company of "plac[ing] commerce above the public interest", while Premier of Ontario Doug Ford stated that everyone in this province has a responsibility to make sure we protect each other and I am very, very disappointed in the store owner that would do this.EB Games later announced that it would close all Canadian stores on March 21. On October 8, 2020, GameStop announced an agreement with Microsoft to migrate backend systems to Microsoft 365 platforms including Dynamics 365, also including in-store usage of Microsoft Surface products by employees.[94] It was later reported that this agreement would also include revenue sharing on all digital game purchases for Xbox Series X and S for each product sold by the retailer, although the exact percentage of this share was not disclosed.',
