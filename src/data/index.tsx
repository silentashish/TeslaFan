The Giga Shanghai was the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company, and was built in less than 6 months.The following year Tesla also started construction on a new Gigafactory in Berlin, Germany, and another in Texas, United States. In March 2020, Tesla began deliveries of its fifth vehicle model, the Model Y crossover.On January 10, 2020, Tesla become the American automaker with the highest market capitalization ever, at $86 billion.On June 10, 2020, Tesla's market capitalization surpassed those of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen combined.The next month, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota's $202 billion to become the world's most valuable automaker by market capitalization.On August 31, 2020, Tesla had a 5-for-1 stock split following the increase in value.From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four profitable quarters in a row for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500. Tesla was added to the index on December 21 of the same year.
